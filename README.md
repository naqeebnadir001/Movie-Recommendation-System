# Recommendation-System



This repository houses the full implementation of a movie recommendation system that employs both case-based and content-based filtering techniques to suggest top movies to users. Utilizing natural language processing and vectorization, the system effectively handles various data preprocessing methods to enhance recommendation accuracy. The project leverages the TMDB 5000 movie dataset, which is also included in this repository.
